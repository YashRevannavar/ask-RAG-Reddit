       "    'body': 'It was. The actual attack - pretty simple and easy. The recon required to know WHAT to attack was the kind of creative part. I\\'m not a super genius computer hacker like the people below are claiming I\\'m trying to act like... I\\'m actually a pretty normal dude. I\\'m a decent hacker because I fucking love it and live for it, but that\\'s all I can really say about me and my abilities.\\n\\nSo here\\'s how it went down. At first yep, it was just your basic DoS attack. Not just DDoS, they had outdated nginx servers and I found some CVEs that I could write some n-days for for memory exhaustion. That was nifty. I also hit their web servers with slow polling attacks just for additional instability. Then there was the just mass bandwidth attack (DDoS) that hit their DNS, MX, and other similar things.\\n\\nHowever the (kind of) unique part was that in additional reconaissance I kept noticing these two IP addresses that would come up. I assumed they were some sort of filter, maybe even a censoring filter? Although that didn\\'t make complete sense because their people don\\'t have access to the Internet, only the elite (aka government). So what I did was I rented a bunch of VPSs surrounding the country and some in China specifically (in case there was some special routing from there). I did a traceroute on all of them with some basic distributed computing tools. Sure enough ANYWHERE I was coming from went through those two assets. They were routers. In other words I found their only two points of egress and ingress to the country.\\n\\nSo I focused most of my attention on those and brought them down with again, yes, just simple bandwidth exhaustion attacks via some open ports. I made requests that would take up a lot of their bandwidth and not a lot of mine (amplifying attack). It worked, when i saw that \"no route to host\" for literally any host within country I knew I\\'d taken their routing completely down. It was a bit of a holy shit moment.\\n\\n  \\nThe attack itself was absolutely not complicated. It was definitely far more complicated figuring out WHAT to attack. Most DDoS is just straightforward stupid shit, but if you take the time to understand the shape of the network it makes a huge difference as it did in this case. So nah, not that complicated, just kinda creative IMO. And no that doesn\\'t mean i think I\\'m some kind of super hacker. Just that I planned well, did recon, and executed.',\n",
